## Understanding Tradeoff Functions for Quantitative Traits

Pleiotropic costs that scale as traits become more elaborate are an underlying assumption for mathematical models in many systems.
For example, in models of quantitative resistance, such assumptions are necesary to prevent host resistance from always reaching their maximum value.
This requires the model to have a function which maps each trait value to a cost value, in terms of mortality or fecundity. 
The choice of such functions is consequential: some functions lead a population to reach a stable intermediate resistance level while others lead to evolutionary branching.
Despite their importance, the difficulty of measuring tradeoff functions in empirical systems means we have little basis to assume a particualar function.
As a first step in addressing this, I have been developing theoretical genetic models where a finite number of seperate loci contribute to the total trait value.

## Modeling Population-Level Spillover Risks

While most dissusions of foreign pathogen spillover risks have focused on exogenous facotrs such as land-cover change and phylogenetic distance between ancestral and naive hosts, it is becoming inceasingly clear that many species exhibit heritable variation in susceptibility to foreign pathogens which they share no coevolutionary history with.
Furthermore, previous theoretical work has shown that the structure of this variation can have major implications for the ability of foreign pathogens to invade and persist in naive populations.
To explore this, I use mathematical models to explore how evolution in response to endemic pathogens can alter population-level susceptiblity to foreign pathogens.
In many systems, susceptible hosts have multiple forms of resistance, some of which are targeted towards certain pathogens (specific resistance) and some of which are more broadly effective (general resistance).
In my first paper from the Bruns Lab, we found that evolution with an endemic pathogen can supress general resistance when specific resistance is maintained in a population.
When we intoduce a foreign pathogen into our simulations, a subset of the host population maintains general resistance, while other maintain specific resistance, but never both simultaneously.
In our followup paper, we found that when endemic pathogens can coevolve with their hosts, hosts maintain general resistance at a higher frequency, and coevolution increases the genetic diversity of host populations.
We also found that the genetic linkage between the loci underlying general and specific resistance plays an important role in the structure of host resistance.
Specifically, if these loci become tighly linked, a population can have a higher spillover risk, as resistance to foreign and endemic pathogens can become negativly correlated.
This leads to a subset of the host population being more susceptible to foreign pathogens than endemic, creating an ecological niche for foreign pathogens to invade and persist.
