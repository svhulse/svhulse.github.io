## Understanding Population-Level Spillover Risks

While most dissusions of foreign pathogen spillover risks have focused on exogenous facotrs such as land-cover change and phylogenetic distance between ancestral and naive hosts, it is becoming inceasingly clear that many species exhibit heritable variation in susceptibility to foreign pathogens which they share no coevolutionary history with.
Furthermore, previous theoretical work has shown that the structure of this variation can have major implications for the ability of foreign pathogens to invade and persist in naive populations.
To explore this, I use mathematical models to explore how evolution in response to endemic pathogens can alter population-level susceptiblity to foreign pathogens.
In many systems, susceptible hosts have multiple forms of resistance, some of which are targeted towards certain pathogens (specific resistance) and some of which are more broadly effective (general resistance).
In my first paper from the Bruns Lab, we found that evolution with an endemic pathogen can supress general resistance when specific resistance is maintained in a population.
When we intoduce a foreign pathogen into our simulations, a subset of the host population maintains general resistance, while other maintain specific resistance, but never both simultaneously.
In our followup paper, we found that when endemic pathogens can coevolve with their hosts, hosts maintain general resistance at a higher frequency, and coevolution increases the genetic diversity of host populations.
We also found that the genetic linkage between the loci underlying general and specific resistance plays an important role in the structure of host resistance.
Specifically, if these loci become tighly linked, a population can have a higher spillover risk, as resistance to foreign and endemic pathogens can become negativly correlated.
This leads to a subset of the host population being more susceptible to foreign pathogens than endemic, creating an ecological niche for foreign pathogens to invade and persist.
