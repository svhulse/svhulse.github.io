As a graduate student, I was a teaching assistant for Comparative Vertebrate Physiology Lab. and Human Anatomy and Physiology Lab. I was fortunate for the opportunity to teach with Dr. Sarah Leupen and Dr. Jennifer Hughes, both of whom have greatly helped develop my teaching style and philosophy. Additionally, I have had developed and given lectures for an animal course, as well as a special topics in sexual selection course. In my current position as a postdoctoral ascociate at UMD, I am developing "Introduction to Python for Life Sciences", a course geared towards biology students with minimal programming experience. The goal of this course is to give students the basic tools they need to be able to use python is a research setting. Moving forward, I hope to develop courses to increase the accessibility of mathematical biology to students who might otherwise feel intimidated by quantitative methods.
